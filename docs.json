    "text": "CopyGetting startedABConvert - How the Script WorksTo perform real-time price testing and split traffic when a user visits, you'll need to install our app script. The script performs these key functions:Splits traffic: When a customer visits a product page, the script assigns them to a group and shows them the corresponding product price. This price will remain consistent throughout the customer’s lifetime to prevent confusion.Cleans up elements on the product page: Our app creates product variants with different prices. To ensure that users do not see variants they are not supposed to see, the script removes these elements.Changes the price of test products on other pages: The script also updates the price of test products on the home page and collection page so that customers will always see the correct price.Counts product views: When a customer visits a product page, the script sends an event to our server, allowing us to track the number of views for each product.FAQsQ: Will the script slow down my website?A: No, our app is optimized and does not block website performance. It will not impact the speed of your website.Q: Why is there an imbalance in the number of views for the test price and the original price?A: Our script assigns visitors to different prices randomly. This may result in an imbalance in the number of views for each group. As the number of views increases, this imbalance should disappear.PreviousABConvert - Getting StartedNextUse CasesLast updated 6 months ago"

    "text": "CopyGetting startedUse Cases💰Price Test Use CasesThe goal of price testing is to find a product's optimal price point for maximum revenue. Should I Price my Products Higher or Lower?The most basic question you might want to answer with A/B testing is if you can:Increase the price without hurting demandDecrease the price and increase enough sales volume to profit. You can simply run a price test by increasing and decreasing a product's price by a certain amount or percentage to verify this.Example ScenarioProduct AControl Price$ 100Test Price 1 (-10%)$ 90Test Price 2 (+10%)$ 110Potential Outcomes and ActionsThe main metric to focus on is the Revenue and Conversion Rate (CVR). Consider choosing the price point with the highest Revenue. You can also observe how change in price will influence the amount of add to carts, checkouts and orders. If you do not see a clear change in CVR, this might mean that customers are less price sensitive to your product. Thus, you can try experimenting with larger price changes. For instance (+- 30%).Should I Match my Competitor's Price?If your product is entering a competitive marketspace, you can research the competing product's price. After understanding competitor prices, run a price test to experiment with:Pricing above competitors to aim for a higher profit margin. Pricing below competitors to aim for capturing more market share.Price matching competitors to defend market share or build brand awareness.Example ScenarioYou have 2 main competitors who prices their products at $100 and $120. You want to test if you can capture more market share by pricing lower or matching competitors.Product AControl Price$ 80Test Price 1$ 100Test Price 2$ 120Potential Outcomes and ActionsThe main metric to reference for decision making is Conversion Rate. Additionally, monitoring the Average Order Value and Profit per Visitor can provide insights into the financial impact of each pricing strategy, allowing you to balance market share and profitability.Price AnchoringBy setting up different \"compare at\" prices, you can test if displaying a higher anchoring price point alongside the actual price will influence consumers' perceived value to increase conversion.Example ScenarioYou want to see if a higher \"compare at price\" will also bring higher Order %. Also, you want to find a balance where the \"compare at price\" is high enough to create perceived value but not so high that it appears unreasonable or deceptive. Product Price$ 100Control Compare at Price$ 120Test Compare at Price$ 150Potential Outcomes and ActionsThe main metric to reference for decision making is Conversion Rate (Order %) . If a higher \"compare at price\" increased Order %, consider adjusting to the test price.If a higher \"compare at price\" decreases Order %, it may be perceived as unreasonable. Lower the anchor to align better with customer expectations and market standards.Remember to run price tests for a sufficient duration to gather statistically significant data. ABConvert recommends a minimum of 10,000 views in total and 200 orders across all test groups for reliable results. Always consider the broader impact of price changes on customer perception, brand positioning, and overall business strategy.PreviousUse CasesNext📦Shipping Test Use CasesLast updated 8 months ago"

This test can help you understand how different thresholds affect customer behavior.Example ScenarioControl ThresholdFree shipping for orders over $30Test Threshold 1Free shipping for orders over $50Test Threshold 2Free shipping for orders over $75Potential Outcomes and ActionsThe main metrics to focus on are Conversion Rate, Average Order Value, and Profit per View.Lower Threshold:Outcome: Higher conversion rate but potentially lower AOV.Action: If the increase in conversions offsets the reduced shipping revenue, consider implementing this threshold.Medium Threshold:Outcome: Balanced conversion rate and AOV.Action: This might be the optimal point if it maximizes overall revenue while maintaining a good conversion rate.Higher Threshold:Outcome: Lower conversion rate but higher AOV.Action: If the increase in AOV significantly boosts overall revenue despite lower conversions, this threshold could be beneficial.Optimizing Flat Rate ShippingTesting different flat rate shipping prices can help you find the highest price customers are willing to pay without negatively impacting conversion rates.Example ScenarioYou want to test if increasing your flat rate shipping price impacts your conversion rate and overall revenue.Control Rate$5.99Test Rate 1$7.99Test Rate 2$9.99Potential Outcomes and ActionsFocus on Conversion Rate, Profit per View, and the Rate Seen metric (which shows how often each shipping rate is viewed by customers).If conversion rates remain stable across higher prices:Consider implementing the higher shipping rate to increase profit margins.If conversion rates drop significantly at higher prices:Find the balance between increased shipping revenue and maintaining conversion rates.If the Rate Seen metric is high but conversion rates are low:Customers frequently see a higher shipping rate but don't complete the purchase, it might indicate that the rate is too high for their liking. Consider lowering the rate to potentially increase conversion.Improving Profitability with Advanced Shipping RateFor businesses with varied product weights or order values, testing with advanced shipping rates can help optimize shipping costs and maintain profitability.Example ScenarioYou want to test different shipping rate structures based on weight.Control RateFlat $9.99 for all ordersTest Rate$5.99 for orders under 5lbs, $9.99 for orders over 5lbsPotential Outcomes and ActionsMonitor Conversion Rate, AOV, and overall Revenue. Also, pay attention to the distribution of order weights or values.If the Test Rate better aligns shipping costs with actual shipping expenses:This could help maintain margins on heavier items while keeping shipping attractive for lighter orders.If the control performs best:The simplicity of a flat rate might be preferred by customers. Consider whether the operational simplicity outweighs potential gains.Remember to run tests for a sufficient duration to gather statistically significant data. Always consider the broader impact on customer experience and operational costs when implementing changes based on test results.Previous💰Price Test Use CasesNext🧩Template Test Use CasesLast updated 8 months ago"

When implementing these features, it's important to consider your testing strategy holistically. While granular targeting through country filters, device types, and traffic sources can yield valuable insights, avoid over-segmenting your audience as this may extend the time needed to reach statistical significance. For optimal results, we recommend focusing on one or two key variables per test and ensuring sufficient sample sizes in each segment. Remember that each targeting option you enable effectively reduces your total test audience, so balance the benefits of precise targeting against the need for quick, reliable results.Previous🔗URL Redirect Test Use CasesNextBest PracticesLast updated 6 months ago"

To ensure the success of your A/B tests with ABConvert, follow these best practices when designing a test.1. Define a Clear HypothesisBefore starting a test, it's essential to have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve. Whether you're testing price sensitivity, content engagement, or shipping options, your goals should be specific and measurable.Start with a specific question or problem you want to address. For example:\"Will increasing the free shipping threshold lead to a higher average order value?\"\"Will changing the product images on the product detail page increase add-to-cart rates?\"\"Will redirecting visitors from a specific ad to a dedicated landing page improve conversion rates?\"Formulate a testable hypothesis. This should be a clear statement about what you expect to happen, i.e. your objective. For example:\"Increasing the free shipping threshold from $50 to $75 will result in a higher average order value.\"\"Using lifestyle images instead of product-only images on the product detail page will increase add-to-cart rates.\"\"Visitors coming from Facebook ads who are redirected to a landing page tailored to that ad campaign will have higher conversion rates than those sent to the general product page.\"Clearly defining your hypothesis will help you design better experiments and determine what metrics to focus on during analysis.2. Choose the Right Test TypeABConvert supports various test types:Price Test: Use this to experiment with different product prices. You can test individual products or run store-wide price adjustments.Shipping Test: This allows you to test variations in shipping rates and free shipping thresholds.URL Redirect Test: This enables you to test the effectiveness of sending traffic to different landing pages or PDPs.Template Tests: Compare page layouts to see effects on key metrics.Theme Test: Use this to compare the performance of different Shopify themes.Select the test type that aligns with your goals. For example, if you want to understand how price affects conversion rates, use the Price Test.3. Set Up Proper Traffic SplitsEnsure that you allocate traffic appropriately between test groups. ABConvert allows you to set traffic splits for up to five groups. A common practice is to start with a 50/50 split for two variations (control vs. variant) and adjust based on the number of variations being tested.For more advanced targeting, you can filter traffic by country or audience (e.g., new vs. returning customers), ensuring that the right audience sees each variation.Learn more about advanced targeting here:How to run price test only on new customer | ABConvert Help Centre4. Use Advanced Filtering Options if NeededABConvert offers advanced filtering options such as traffic source and country-based filters. These allow you to run tests on specific segments of your audience:Traffic Source Filters: Target visitors based on their traffic source (e.g., Google Ads or Facebook campaigns).Learn more about UTM (traffic source) filter here:How to set up UTM filter for price test | ABConvert Help CentreCountry Filters: Run tests in specific countries while showing the original version in other regions.This ensures that your tests are relevant to specific user groups and helps in gathering more actionable insights.5. Check Your Test After LaunchAlways check your tests after launching them. ABConvert provides multiple ways to preview tests:Use the preview URL from the analytics dashboard.Add /?preview=0 or /?preview=1 to the end of the URL to view how each group will experience the test.This step helps ensure that everything works as expected across different devices and browsers.For more details, refer toHow to verify if the test is working | ABConvert Help Centre6. Monitor Key MetricsOnce your test is live, monitor key performance metrics such as:Conversion ratesAverage order value (AOV)RevenueABConvert provides detailed analytics dashboards where you can track these metrics in real-time.7. Ensure Statistical SignificanceTo make informed decisions based on your A/B test results, ensure that your test reaches statistical significance. ABConvert recommends running tests until you have at least 10,000 views and 200 orders in total. This ensures that your results are not due to random chance but reflect real user behavior.The Statistical Significance section in ABConvert’s analytics dashboard provides a quick and easy way to see whether your test results are statistically significant.Check out this article for more details:How to Interpret Statistical Significance? | ABConvert Help CentreGive the test enough time to collect meaningful data. Avoid making changes to the test or the website during the testing period, as this can skew results.8. Analyze Results and Draw ConclusionsAfter completing an A/B test, refer back to your hypothesis and thoroughly analyze the results using ABConvert’s analytics dashboard:Compare your target metric such as: conversion rates, across different variations.Look at secondary metrics like average order value or profit per visitor.Use insights from the test to decide which version to implement to your store, or inform future optimization efforts.If needed, run follow-up tests based on what you learned from the initial experiment.Learn more about managing your tests:How to manage Duplicate Product | ABConvert Help CentreHow to end a price test safely for subscription products | ABConvert Help CentreBy following these best practices when designing A/B tests with ABConvert, you'll be able to gather actionable insights that can significantly improve your store's performance across pricing strategies, content engagement, shipping options, and more.PreviousBest PracticesNextCase StudiesLast updated 6 months ago"

Known for offering competitive pricing and fast shipping across Europe, they cater to a broad audience seeking feature-packed wearables without the luxury price tag.Their catalog includes a variety of models designed for fitness, lifestyle, and tech-savvy shoppers—making them a go-to destination for practical smartwatch solutions that look good and perform well.From Instinct to System: The BackstoryBy mid-2024, Smartwatchmagazijn had already carved out a strong niche in the European wearables market. They had demand, solid margins, and strong paid acquisition channels—but their growth still relied heavily on instinct.“We knew our gut instincts were good—but they weren’t scalable,”says Robbert Weimer, owner of Smartwatchmagazijn.“We needed a way to validate decisions faster and grow without increasing ad spend.”That was the turning point. In search of a system they could trust, the team implemented ABConvert to start testing hypotheses—on price, layout, and offer structure—with real data.507 Experiments Later: What the Data RevealsRobbert’s team didn’t just install ABConvert—they made it part of their growth process. Since onboarding, they’ve launched 507 experiments, putting them in the top 1% of merchants by testing volume on the platform.Test TypeExperiments RunCompletion RateAvg. DurationTemplate Tests260High~3–4 daysPrice Tests247Very High~4–5 daysAnd they weren’t testing fluff.Template tests included upsell placements, CTA reordering, layout shifts, and mobile optimizations.Price tests covered everything from €10 deltas to shipping bundle value comparisons.Most tests had statistically valid outcomes in under 5 days.Instead of waiting for monthly reports or gut feels, they built a machine that generated learning every single week.The Breakthrough Moment: €10,000/Month UpliftOne of their early tests captured the power of offer framing perfectly.They compared two versions of a product bundle:€79 with standard shipping€89 with free express shippingThe higher price point not only held conversion—it increased average order value (AOV) dramatically. Customers valued the perceived upgrade in shipping speed more than the small increase in price.“After just one month, our monthly revenue had grown by 25% — without more traffic or higher ad costs,” Robbert shared.“ABConvert costs €59/month and delivered over €10,000 in additional revenue.”The real win? This wasn’t a lucky test—it became a repeatable playbook they applied across multiple products.How They Run Experiments: Inside the PlaybookWhat makes Smartwatchmagazijn different isn’t just what they test—it’s how they test.Their Testing Cadence2–3 experiments launched every weekMondays are for test planning, Tuesdays for launchFridays = decision day (deploy or discard)Each test runs ~4 days to hit statistical confidenceOps Tactics That Keep It RunningWinners are tagged directly in Shopify for fast rolloutTheme edits are scheduled early to avoid weekend blockersResults are logged in a shared Google Sheet with learnings, actions, and next-test ideas“We treat testing like product development,” Robbert says.“We don’t just run a test—we document it, learn from it, and systematize the rollout.”This approach ensures the learning doesn’t live in someone’s head—it becomes part of the business DNA.Real Lessons for Other Shopify MerchantsSmartwatchmagazijn’s growth wasn’t a fluke—and you don’t need 500 tests to get started. But here’s what you can learn from them:1. Start Where Revenue LivesThey didn’t waste time on button colors or popups. They tested pricing, offer structure, and layout—the stuff that moves revenue.2. Speed CompoundsThe more you test, the more you learn. The more you learn, the faster you grow. Weekly testing gives you more feedback loops—and more control.3. Be SurprisedSome of their biggest wins were non-intuitive. That’s the value of data—it proves or disproves what your gut can’t.4. System > SparkThe real unlock wasn’t one experiment—it was a repeatable system. Testing became a ritual, not a rescue plan.Merchant Quote“Once you know what works, you can apply it across your entire store—and keep testing new ideas for even better results.”Robbert Weimer, owner of SmartwatchmagazijnReady to Build Your Own Testing Engine?If you're a Shopify brand that’s scaling—or planning to—ABConvert can help you turn your store into a testing engine:Native Shopify integrationTheme-safe, revenue-focused testsPrice, content, layout, and shipping experimentsReal data.

    "text": "CopyPrice testsPrice Tests - Getting StartedWhat is Price Testing?Price testing is an experimental approach to assess the impact of offering a product at different price points. It uncovers valuable insights into customer demand, market trends, and optimal pricing strategies to maximize conversions.With the ABConvert app, conducting price tests is simple. You can quickly set up and customize tests by selecting products, defining test prices, and configuring traffic distribution rules—all in just a few clicks.How Price Tests work?Preparation: The setup process depends on your chosen testing method. Our current testing methods are: Duplicate Variant, Duplicate Product and Cart Transform. Refer to the next section for details on different approaches.Traffic Splitting: Traffic is split between the original product/variant and its duplicate(s). For instance, 50% of visitors are directed to the original price and 50% to the test price. Visitors are consistently shown the same price throughout the test.Data Collection: Scripts track user interactions on the product page, such as views, add-to-cart actions, checkouts, and purchases. All metrics are recorded and aggregated for analysis.Results Analysis: After running the test for a sufficient period, insights are derived from the data. Statistical tools are used to compare the performance of each price group, identifying the most effective pricing strategy.Price Test Methods ExplainedDuplicate Variant (Default)\nThis method creates duplicate options of a product for testing. For example, if a product has three purchase options, three additional purchase options are generated with test prices applied. On the frontend, our script ensures a seamless experience by hiding irrelevant purchase options for users based on their assigned test group.Duplicate Product\nThis method duplicates entire products with test prices applied, creating two or more identical products with different prices in the store. Users in each test group are only shown the product relevant to their group. Note that this method requires additional setup before launching the test. For more details on managing duplicate products, please refer to this article.Cart Transform (Shopify Plus Exclusive)\nShopify's cart transformation function dynamically adjusts prices when products are added to the cart. This method minimizes disruptions, avoids inventory tracking and theme configuration issues, and allows previews without impacting your live store.Next Steps?This article provides a foundational overview of price testing and the logic behind running tests.

    "text": "CopyShipping testsShipping Tests - Getting StartedGet started with running A/B tests on your Shopify shipping thresholds and rates with ABConvertWhat Are Shipping Tests?Shipping tests are experiments designed to evaluate and optimize the delivery options offered during the checkout process. By testing different shipping methods, rates, or configurations, you can identify the most effective options that maximizes conversion rate and sales. Shipping tests are crucial in the e-commerce landscape, where shipping plays an important role in purchase decisions.ABConvert uses Carrier Service API from Shopify to generate shipping rates. This service is available to stores in the Advanced or Plus plan.Refer to this article for more on how to enable Carrier Service API:How can I enable the Carrier Service API for my store? | ABConvert Help CentreWhen Should I Choose Shipping Tests?Shipping tests are ideal when:You want to compare different shipping rates (e.g., free shipping vs. flat-rate shipping).You're introducing new delivery options (e.g., express shipping or local pickup).You want to test out conditional shipping rates (e.g. adjust shipping fee based on product weight).Types of Shipping TestsThere are three types of shipping tests that provide value for different aspects in your store.Flat Rate: Allows you to test for different shipping rates. You can assess which flat rate leads to better performance with analytics results. Besides, you can set a free shipping threshold at the same time to ensure a complete shopping experience for your customers.Free Shipping Threshold: You can evaluates the impact of varying free shipping thresholds on customer behavior.Advanced Shipping: Allows you to implement multiple condition-based shipping rates to each test group. This method is particularly effective for tailoring shipping strategies to specific order details including order price, item weight and transit time.For more use cases, refer to this document:📦Shipping Test Use CasesHow Shipping Tests WorkShipping tests are built around Shopify's shipping profiles and require careful configuration to ensure accurate results. The logic of shipping tests is: Shipping Profiles and Zones: Each shipping test is linked to a specific shipping profile. You need to select the appropriate shipping zone for the test, ensuring that the rates apply only to customers in that region. Adding Test Rates: Define the shipping rates for each test variant (e.g., flat rate, free shipping threshold, or advanced shipping conditions). These rates are dynamically applied based on the test group assigned to the customer. Deleting Pre-existing Rates: Before launching the test, you must follow the steps in ABConvert to delete any existing rates that you want to A/B test in the shipping profile for the selected zone. The deleted rates will be automatically restored after you end the test. This ensures that only the test rates are applied during checkout. Analytics Tracking: Web pixel tracks user interactions with shipping options, including selection rates and their impact on conversion metrics like average order value (AOV) and checkout completion rates.Customer Experience ExampleHere’s an example of how a Shipping Test might look from a customer’s perspective:Original Experience: A customer visits the checkout page and sees a standard shipping rate with no free shipping option.Test Experience: Another customer visits the same checkout page but is presented with a test variant offering free shipping for orders over $50, encouraging the customer to add more items to their cart.ConclusionShipping testing is a powerful tool in the e-commerce world. By understanding and applying different shipping strategies, you can enhance customer experience and boost your sales. We encourage you to follow the instructions in the next article to optimize your store's performance. If you encounter issues with enabling carrier services, displaying shipping rates, or have questions about more advanced tests, don't hesitate to contact our support team at support@abconvert.io or via the in-app support widget.

    "text": "CopyShipping testsShipping Tests - How to Set UpSet up a Shipping Test with ABConvert in a few simple stepsStep 1: Activate Carrier RatesTo begin a new shipping test in ABConvert, click on \"Create New Test\" located at the top right of the screen. When running the shipping test for the first time, a message will appear at the top, prompting you to check if your Shopify store supports carrier rates. Please refer to the above information for further details about carrier rates.\n​\nAfter the carrier rate check is complete, your store will be able to begin running Shipping Tests.Make sure you double check if your carrier rate is successfully enabled in the Settings -> Shipping and Delivery.📌 We normally recommend you remove the origin rate during the testing period in order to prevent conflict. However, if you have multiple rate such as Standard v.s. Express. You just have to remove the rate that you are testing.Remember, do name the Shipping rate different than the existing rate (the rate you have not removed), otherwise Shopify will always return the rate with lower price if there are rates with the same name.Step 2: Create Your TestOnce in the Shipping Test page you're presented with all the options required to get your shipping test up and running. We'll walk through the different blocks available for configuration in this section.Test InformationThis block contains the test name which is used to easily reference this test and analytics in the future as well as the hypothesis (description) for what you're hoping to achieve. This cannot be changed once a test has started.\n​Traffic PercentageThis section allows you to configure what % of traffic will see which variant. We recommend leaving this on 50/50 to get the most accurate results.🎯 Initially you might notice a significant disparity in the amount of traffic between the two variants, but over time, it will even out to within 1 - 2% of the predetermined percentage.Shipping Test TypeABConvert offers three types of tests, namely the Free Shipping Threshold, Flat Rate Shipping, and Advanced Shipping.VariantsIn the variants section, you can specify the free shipping threshold for each group if you choose the free shipping threshold test type, or set the flat rate shipping rates if you choose the flat rate shipping test type. The values are defined in your store's default currency.Shipping CountriesThe shipping countries section is where can you choose which country your test will be active for. Please note that all checkouts with products in a selected shipping country will be part of the shipping test.🎯 Although you can conduct multiple shipping tests concurrently, each active test is restricted to one test per country. This ensures that we obtain the most precise outcomes for every test and country you're evaluating.Step 3: Confirm Shipping ConfigurationBefore launching your shipping test, the Checkout Configuration section needs to be set up. This section allows you to customize how the rate is displayed at checkout by choosing a shipping rate name and creating a personalized shipping description. ABConvert is the ONLY shipping test app to offer the unique feature of setting a custom transit time to measure the effects of shorter or longer shipping times.\n​\nAt the bottom of this step, a checkout preview is available to show you precisely what will be displayed during checkout and what rates might appear depending on the test group.That's it! Your new test is all setup and ready to go. Just hit the next button at the bottom and we'll start providing shipping rates. If there are any errors we'll also let you know prior to the test going live.Step 4: Delete Original Shipping Rates Shopify currently returns only one rate with the lowest price if there are multiple rates with the same name. You will need to delete the rate you are testing to ensure accurate shipping.You can either delete your rate manually in your \"Shipping and Delivery\" settings in Shopify and add the rate back after you end the test, or you can select the rate to delete in our final review modal. Our app will delete the rate and recover it for you after you close the test.⚠️ Multiple rates might be displayed, or your test rate might not appear if you do not delete the rate you are testing.Step 5: Preview the testAfter create a shipping test, you can navigate to the analytics page and click summary to preview the test. Or you can follow the below instruction.🎯 Not seeing the right experiment on your store? To provide a fast and seamless experience for your customers we cache experiment data for a period of up to 5 minutes. This won't affect customers' checkout capabilities. If you'd like to test it yourself without waiting, simply append `?preview=0&country=<country code>` or ?preview=1&country=<country code> to your URL bar, allowing you to preview the ongoing experiment.You can look up the country codes here:CountryCode - Storefront APIShopify🏁 Ready to level up your shipping test?Check out these resources to level up your shipping test:Learn about setting up Advanced Shipping Tests:How to create Advanced Shipping Test | ABConvert Help CentreLearn about setting up a free shipping banner:The guide to setting page of ABConvert | ABConvert Help CentrePreviousShipping Tests - Getting StartedNextShipping Tests - QA ChecklistLast updated 7 months ago"

To clear up any confusion, this article provides a deep dive into the mechanism behind ABConvert's shipping rates.How Carrier Rates WorkWhen you enable our carrier rate (now handled automatically within the app), a carrier rate will be added to your Default Shipping Profile. However, for other shipping profiles, you’ll need to manually add the rate.ABConvert’s carrier rate dynamically returns shipping rates based on your A/B testing conditions, making it possible to test different shipping prices for different customer segments.Example: A/B Testing Shipping RatesSuppose you set up a shipping test with the following conditions:Control Group: Standard Shipping - $5Variant A Group: Standard Shipping - $10At checkout, customers will see different shipping rates based on their assigned group:- Control- Variant AThe underlying process works as follows:Why should the rate be deleted?When setting up a shipping test, users may come across this section and wonder why it appears.The reason for this is that Shopify automatically returns the lowest rate if multiple shipping rates share the same name.Let's go over the flow again with an example:If you want shipping rates to dynamically return different values for different users, deleting the rate is necessary. This ensures that the system does not default to the lowest available rate but instead applies the correct rate based on the test conditions.Then the flow becomes:After deleting the original rate, you can achieve the scenario you want.ConclusionThis article explains how the carrier rate mechanism works, helping you apply the logic to set up your shipping test correctly.PreviousShipping Tests - QA ChecklistNextURL Redirect Tests - Getting StartedLast updated 4 months ago"

    "text": "CopyURL Redirect testsURL Redirect Tests - Getting StartedGet started with running A/B tests on your PDPs, landing pages, collection pages, and more with ABConvertWhat Are URL Redirect Tests?A URL Redirect Test is a type of A/B testing where visitors are redirected to alternate URLs to compare the performance of different versions of a webpage. This method is particularly useful for testing variations of landing pages, product pages, or other key website elements without modifying the original page directly. When Should I Choose URL Redirect Tests?URL Redirect Tests are ideal in the following scenarios:Testing Landing Pages: When you want to compare the effectiveness of different landing pages in driving conversions.Product Page Image Testing: If you want to test different product images on your product page, URL Redirect Tests can be used to test these variations by redirecting traffic between original and duplicate pages.How URL Redirect Tests WorkThe core logic of a URL Redirect Test involves two main components:Trigger Conditions:These are predefined rules that determine when a redirect should occur. Trigger conditions can include:Matching specific page URLs or query strings.Using logical operators (AND/OR) to combine rules.Operators like \"Matches Exactly,\" \"Contains,\" \"Starts With,\" \"Ends With,\"Using regex patterns for complex matching.Test Group Settings :The destination URLs for each test group. Destination URLs are the URLs where users are redirected once the trigger conditions are met.The percentage of traffic allocated to each variation (e.g., 50% control, 50% test).Whether query strings should be preserved during redirection.How the Audience is SplitThe audience is divided into groups based on traffic allocation settings. Typically, visitors are randomly assigned to either the control group (original page) or one or more test groups (redirected pages). This ensures unbiased results and fair comparison between variations.Customer Experience ExampleOriginal Experience: A visitor lands on www.example.com/product and interacts with the original product page.Test Experience: A visitor lands on www.example.com/product but is redirected to www.example.com/product-test, which features modified content or design.ConclusionURL Redirect Tests provide a flexible way to compare webpage variations without altering the original content. By defining clear trigger conditions, splitting audiences fairly, and analyzing user behavior, businesses can make data-driven decisions about their web pages' content or design. This approach is particularly useful for testing landing pages or product pages while maintaining compatibility with ad policies from platforms like Google and Facebook.Learn more about URL testing and Google or Facebook Ads Policy here: Will I Violate Google or Facebook Ads Policy with URL Redirect Tests?\n\nPreviousShipping Tests - Shipping Rates MechanismNextURL Redirect Tests - How to Set UpLast updated 6 months ago"

For instance, redirect all traffic from the homepage (www.example.com) to either a collection page or another landing page.Learn more about how to set up the correct trigger conditions here:URL Redirect Tests - Trigger ConditionsImportant Notes:If you want every visitor to see one of two pages, ensure you set trigger conditions for both URLs.For regex-based conditions, ensure your expressions are valid and tested before launching.Step 3: Configure Redirect OptionsOnce trigger conditions are set:Specify the destination URLs where visitors will be redirected.\nAllocate traffic percentages between variations (e.g., 50% for the original page and 50% for the test page).\nChoose whether to preserve query strings during redirection. Preserving query strings ensures any tracking parameters remain intact.Step 4: Choose Trigger FrequencyABConvert offers two options for how often redirects are triggered:Always Trigger: Redirects occur every time a visitor meets the condition. This is ideal for tests where visitors need consistent exposure to one version of the page.Trigger Only Once: The redirect happens only once per visitor journey, resetting after a purchase or significant event. This is useful for testing landing pages without disrupting subsequent visits.Step 5: Preview Your TestAfter setting up the test, you will be redirected to the \"Your Tests\" list.Click the test title, and go to the analytics page.Click on \"Summary\" to preview each variation using the provided preview links or by visiting the URLs in incognito mode.Double-check that all trigger conditions and redirects function as expected.Once satisfied, launch your test and let it run for an appropriate duration to gather meaningful data.Step 6: Monitor AnalyticsAfter launching your test, monitor its performance through ABConvert's analytics dashboard:Summary View: Check metrics like conversion rates, average staying time, add-to-cart rates, and checkout rates.Visitor Events: Analytics track unique visitors who triggered redirects and attribute their actions (e.g., add-to-cart or purchase) to specific test variations.Staying Time: This metric adjusts for scrolling and idle time, providing accurate insights into user engagement.ABConvert removes outliers from staying time data to ensure accuracy in performance evaluation.ConclusionSetting up a URL Redirect Test with ABConvert is straightforward and allows you to compare different versions of web pages effectively. By defining clear trigger conditions, configuring redirect settings, and analyzing results through detailed metrics, you can make data-driven decisions to optimize your website’s performance.For further assistance or questions, reach out via support@abconvert.io or use the in-app support widget.PreviousURL Redirect Tests - Getting StartedNextURL Redirect Tests - Trigger ConditionsLast updated 7 months ago"

    "text": "CopyTemplate testsTemplate Tests - Getting StartedGet started with running A/B tests on your Shopify templates with ABConvertWhat Are Template Tests?Template Tests allow you to compare the performance of different page templates within your Shopify store. This is particularly useful for testing variations of product pages, landing pages, or other key templates to determine which design or layout performs better. Template Tests operate by leveraging alternate templates in Shopify and using scripts to manage their display. The process involves:Assigning different templates to different types of pages (home page / collection page/ product page).Redirecting visitors to these templates based on test settings.Tracking performance metrics through analytics tools.This method enables you to test different designs without disrupting your live theme, making it a flexible and powerful tool for optimization.When Should I Choose Template Tests?Product Page Design Optimization: Template Tests are ideal for testing variations of product page layouts, such as different descriptions, image placements, or call-to-action buttons. This helps identify which design drives better engagement and conversions.Landing Page Performance Testing: Use Template Tests to experiment with alternate landing page designs and layouts to determine which one leads to higher conversion rates. This is especially useful for testing promotional campaigns or seasonal offers.Testing Multiple Templates Without URL Changes: If you want to test different designs while keeping the same URL structure (e.g., no redirects), Template Tests are the perfect choice. They allow you to dynamically render different templates through Shopify’s ?view=template-suffix system, ensuring a seamless user experience without altering page URLsFor more Template Test use cases, check out this document:🧩Template Test Use CasesHow Template Tests WorkSet Up Templates: Create or select alternate templates for the pages you want to test (e.g., product pages, collection pages, or home pages). These templates can include variations in layout, content placement, or design elements.Assign Templates to Variants: Assign the default template to the original group and the alternate template to the variant (test group). This ensures customers are split between the two experiences.When using ABConvert to run template tests on product pages, users often encounter confusion due to Shopify's limitation: a single product can only be assigned to one template at a time. The short answer is: the variant template in your test does not need to be assigned to the same product as the original template. It can be any published template within your theme.Preview and Test: Use the preview feature to ensure that both templates display correctly and align with your store's branding.Launch the Test: Start the test by splitting traffic between the control group (default template) and the test group (alternate template). Customers are automatically directed to one of the two templates during their visit.Monitor Analytics: Track key performance metrics such as bounce rate, time spent on page, conversion rate, and average order value (AOV) for each template. Analytics tools will help you compare how each template performs.Apply the Winner Template: If one template outperforms the other, you can make it the default for your store or continue testing further variations to optimize performance. Note that you need to manually apply the winner template to your store due to Shopify restrictions.Customer Experience ExampleHere’s an example of how a Template Test might look from a customer’s perspective:Original Experience: A customer visits a product page assigned to the default template. This template features standard product descriptions and layout elements.Test Experience: Another customer visits the same product page but is redirected to a variant template. This variant might include enhanced visuals or a different layout.ConclusionTemplate Tests provide a seamless way to optimize your Shopify store by comparing different designs and layouts. As customers interact with these pages, ABConvert tracks key metrics like conversion rates, time spent on pages, and add-to-cart actions. This data helps you identify which template resonates better with their audience and drives improved outcomes.

    "text": "CopyAnalyticsAnalytics DiscrepanciesWe outline the primary reasons for differences to Shopify's analyticsA common question from users is: Why is the numbers in the ABConvert analytics dashboard different from Shopify? While it may seem like data should match across platforms, the reality is that tracking methods differ significantly, which lead to discrepancies. Below, we outline the primary reasons for these differences.1. Differences in Visitor and Session DefinitionsDefinitionABConvertShopifyVisitorA visitor is equal to a session that lasts 30 minutes. It resets after 30 minutes (no matter if there is activity or not) or when a new browser session begins.Visitors are counted once per unique purchasing journey.A visitor is defined as a unique individual who interacts with the store. Visitors are deduplicated across sessions and devices.SessionSessions are the same as visitors. A session lasts 30 minutes. It resets after 30 minutes (no matter if there is activity or not) or when a new browser session begins.Sessions are defined as 30 minutes of continuous activity, resetting after inactivity or new browser sessions.2. Differences in Event Tracking MethodsDefinitionABConvertShopifyEvent RecordingEvents (e.g., add-to-cart, checkout) are recorded at most once per session to prevent double counting. Each visitor or session can only attribute one event per funnel step.Events are recorded based on Shopify’s predefined tracking logic, which may include multiple events within a single session.Data Collection MethodsUses web pixels, JavaScript scripts, and webhooks to collect data directly from user interactions during tests.Relies on its analytics infrastructure to collect data from various store interactions and channels.Data Collection LimitationCheckout event tracking: if customers use shop pay or express checkout, the events cannot be tracked in ABConvert due to the exclusion of web pixel event.N/A3. Inclusion/Exclusion of Bot TrafficABConvert employs anti-bot measures to ensure only real visitor data is recorded. Events like product views or add-to-cart actions are only captured if they are tied to genuine user interactions.4. Privacy Settings and Browser RestrictionsModern browsers like Safari block third-party cookies and certain JavaScript trackers by default. Additionally, privacy tools like ad blockers can prevent analytics scripts from firing. This will result in discrepancies in conversion metrics.ABConvert uses first-party scripts and web pixels for tracking but may still encounter issues with blocked events in some environments (e.g., TikTok’s in-app browser).Order Discrepancies Between Product Tests and Shopify ReportsOrder discrepancies often occur when comparing ABConvert's product test reports with Shopify's order data:ABConvert: Attributes orders to a test if the visitor interacted with a tested product page at any point during their session. This includes cases where the final purchase contains products that were not part of the test. The logic is based on the idea that the tested experience influenced the visitor's behavior during their shopping journey.Shopify: Attributes orders directly to specific products or collections included in the purchase. It does not consider whether the visitor interacted with a tested product page earlier in their session unless that product is part of the final transaction.For example:If a visitor views a tested product page but purchases an unrelated item later in their journey, ABConvert attributes that order to the test group because the tested experience influenced their behavior.Shopify would not attribute this order to the tested product unless it was directly included in the purchase.Recommendations for UsersTo minimize confusion when comparing analytics:Understand how each platform defines key metrics like sessions, visitors, and orders.Use ABConvert’s analytics dashboard to focus on metrics specifically designed for A/B testing performance evaluation, such as: AOV and conversion rates.For deeper validation, export raw data from both platforms (e.g., order IDs) and compare manually.If you encounter discrepancies that seem unusual or unexplained, feel free to contact our support team for assistance via the in-app support widget.PreviousABConvert Analytics DefinitionNextStatistical Significance InterpretationLast updated 6 months ago"

    "text": "CopyAnalyticsStatistical Significance InterpretationABConvert includes tools to help determine statistical significance in your test results. This involves hypothesis testing to identify if differences between test groups are statistically significant. For reliable insights, ensure your tests have sufficient data—typically at least 10,000 views and 200 orders.Understanding Hypothesis TestingOne-Sided Hypothesis: Tests for an effect in one specific direction (e.g., whether a new price increases sales). Use this when you have a specific prediction about the direction of the effect.Two-Sided Hypothesis: Allows for an effect in either direction (e.g., whether a new price changes sales, either up or down). Choose this when you are unsure about the direction of the effect or want to detect any change.Understanding Confidence LevelConfidence level determines how strict you are when evaluating an A/B test. The higher the confidence level, the greater the difference needed to declare the test results statistically significant. It is often used alongside p-value, which is calculated from your data.For example, if you have a p-value of 0.05:Under a 99% confidence level, the result is not significant because (1 - 0.05) = 95%, which is less than the required 99% confidence level.However, at a 90% confidence level, the result is significant because 95% is greater than 90%.How to Choose the Right Confidence LevelThe choice of confidence level depends on the cost of a Type 1 error (false positive) — when you mistakenly believe the variant is better when it’s actually not.For example:If you're changing the color of a \"Buy Now\" button and there's no development work required, you might be okay with a lower confidence level (e.g., 90%) since the cost of being wrong is low.If you're making a complex checkout redesign that requires significant engineering effort, you'd want a higher confidence level (e.g., 99%) to reduce the risk of rolling out a change that doesn’t actually improve conversions.In short:Higher confidence level → Stricter test → Less chance of false positivesLower confidence level → More relaxed test → More chance of false positives, but faster decisionsInterpreting ResultsWhile ABConvert provides a \"Conclusion\" in the Statistical significance section to help you know if your test is statistically significant at a glance, it might be useful to understand each metric used to get that conclusion:Lift: The percentage change in a certain metric between test groups, such as the conversion rates between original versus test group. Lift helps determine the effectiveness of a change or variant in your A/B test.Confidence: Represents the probability that the results of an experiment are not due to random chance. It indicates how certain you can be about your test results. Common confidence levels are 90%, 95%, and 99%.P-value: Indicator of statistical reliability. A low p-value (typically <0.05) suggests significant differences between groups.How Our p-value is CalculatedStep 1: Calculate the Z-ScoreThe Z-score tells you how different the two conversion rates (your primary metric) are compared to what’s expected by chance. It’s calculated using:Step 2: Convert the Z-Score to a P-ValueThe p-value tells you the probability of getting the observed difference if there were actually no real effect.If you’re running a one-tailed test, the p-value measures the probability of getting a result as extreme as your observed data.\nIf you’re running a two-tailed test, the p-value is doubled to account for differences in either direction.Example: A/B Test in ActionLet’s say you test a new button color on your checkout page:Variant A (original button): 5% conversion rate, 1,000 usersVariant B (new button): 6% conversion rate, 1,000 usersTest type: Two-tailed (checking for any difference)Using the formula, you calculate:Z-score ≈ -1.12P-value ≈ 0.263Since p = 0.263 is greater than 0.05 (95% confidence level), the result is not statistically significant. This means the difference could be due to random chance rather than a real effect.What This Means for Your TestIf p-value < 0.05: Your result is statistically significant, meaning the variant likely had a real impact.If p-value > 0.05: Your result is not statistically significant, so the change might not be meaningful.Note: Under 95% confidence level.ConclusionThis article explains how to utilize the ABConvert statistical significance tool to help you determine the statistical significance of your A/B test results, ensuring that any observed differences between test groups are not due to random chance.PreviousAnalytics DiscrepanciesNextChangelogLast updated 3 months ago"

    "text": "CopyPrice testsPrice Tests - Getting StartedWhat is Price Testing?Price testing is an experimental approach to assess the impact of offering a product at different price points. It uncovers valuable insights into customer demand, market trends, and optimal pricing strategies to maximize conversions.With the ABConvert app, conducting price tests is simple. You can quickly set up and customize tests by selecting products, defining test prices, and configuring traffic distribution rules—all in just a few clicks.How Price Tests work?Preparation: The setup process depends on your chosen testing method. Our current testing methods are: Duplicate Variant, Duplicate Product and Cart Transform. Refer to the next section for details on different approaches.Traffic Splitting: Traffic is split between the original product/variant and its duplicate(s). For instance, 50% of visitors are directed to the original price and 50% to the test price. Visitors are consistently shown the same price throughout the test.Data Collection: Scripts track user interactions on the product page, such as views, add-to-cart actions, checkouts, and purchases. All metrics are recorded and aggregated for analysis.Results Analysis: After running the test for a sufficient period, insights are derived from the data. Statistical tools are used to compare the performance of each price group, identifying the most effective pricing strategy.Price Test Methods ExplainedDuplicate Variant (Default)\nThis method creates duplicate options of a product for testing. For example, if a product has three purchase options, three additional purchase options are generated with test prices applied. On the frontend, our script ensures a seamless experience by hiding irrelevant purchase options for users based on their assigned test group.Duplicate Product\nThis method duplicates entire products with test prices applied, creating two or more identical products with different prices in the store. Users in each test group are only shown the product relevant to their group. Note that this method requires additional setup before launching the test. For more details on managing duplicate products, please refer to this article.Cart Transform (Shopify Plus Exclusive)\nShopify's cart transformation function dynamically adjusts prices when products are added to the cart. This method minimizes disruptions, avoids inventory tracking and theme configuration issues, and allows previews without impacting your live store.Next Steps?This article provides a foundational overview of price testing and the logic behind running tests.

    "text": "CopyShipping testsShipping Tests - Getting StartedGet started with running A/B tests on your Shopify shipping thresholds and rates with ABConvertWhat Are Shipping Tests?Shipping tests are experiments designed to evaluate and optimize the delivery options offered during the checkout process. By testing different shipping methods, rates, or configurations, you can identify the most effective options that maximizes conversion rate and sales. Shipping tests are crucial in the e-commerce landscape, where shipping plays an important role in purchase decisions.ABConvert uses Carrier Service API from Shopify to generate shipping rates. This service is available to stores in the Advanced or Plus plan.Refer to this article for more on how to enable Carrier Service API:How can I enable the Carrier Service API for my store? | ABConvert Help CentreWhen Should I Choose Shipping Tests?Shipping tests are ideal when:You want to compare different shipping rates (e.g., free shipping vs. flat-rate shipping).You're introducing new delivery options (e.g., express shipping or local pickup).You want to test out conditional shipping rates (e.g. adjust shipping fee based on product weight).Types of Shipping TestsThere are three types of shipping tests that provide value for different aspects in your store.Flat Rate: Allows you to test for different shipping rates. You can assess which flat rate leads to better performance with analytics results. Besides, you can set a free shipping threshold at the same time to ensure a complete shopping experience for your customers.Free Shipping Threshold: You can evaluates the impact of varying free shipping thresholds on customer behavior.Advanced Shipping: Allows you to implement multiple condition-based shipping rates to each test group. This method is particularly effective for tailoring shipping strategies to specific order details including order price, item weight and transit time.For more use cases, refer to this document:📦Shipping Test Use CasesHow Shipping Tests WorkShipping tests are built around Shopify's shipping profiles and require careful configuration to ensure accurate results. The logic of shipping tests is: Shipping Profiles and Zones: Each shipping test is linked to a specific shipping profile. You need to select the appropriate shipping zone for the test, ensuring that the rates apply only to customers in that region. Adding Test Rates: Define the shipping rates for each test variant (e.g., flat rate, free shipping threshold, or advanced shipping conditions). These rates are dynamically applied based on the test group assigned to the customer. Deleting Pre-existing Rates: Before launching the test, you must follow the steps in ABConvert to delete any existing rates that you want to A/B test in the shipping profile for the selected zone. The deleted rates will be automatically restored after you end the test. This ensures that only the test rates are applied during checkout. Analytics Tracking: Web pixel tracks user interactions with shipping options, including selection rates and their impact on conversion metrics like average order value (AOV) and checkout completion rates.Customer Experience ExampleHere’s an example of how a Shipping Test might look from a customer’s perspective:Original Experience: A customer visits the checkout page and sees a standard shipping rate with no free shipping option.Test Experience: Another customer visits the same checkout page but is presented with a test variant offering free shipping for orders over $50, encouraging the customer to add more items to their cart.ConclusionShipping testing is a powerful tool in the e-commerce world. By understanding and applying different shipping strategies, you can enhance customer experience and boost your sales. We encourage you to follow the instructions in the next article to optimize your store's performance. If you encounter issues with enabling carrier services, displaying shipping rates, or have questions about more advanced tests, don't hesitate to contact our support team at support@abconvert.io or via the in-app support widget.

    "text": "CopyURL Redirect testsURL Redirect Tests - Getting StartedGet started with running A/B tests on your PDPs, landing pages, collection pages, and more with ABConvertWhat Are URL Redirect Tests?A URL Redirect Test is a type of A/B testing where visitors are redirected to alternate URLs to compare the performance of different versions of a webpage. This method is particularly useful for testing variations of landing pages, product pages, or other key website elements without modifying the original page directly. When Should I Choose URL Redirect Tests?URL Redirect Tests are ideal in the following scenarios:Testing Landing Pages: When you want to compare the effectiveness of different landing pages in driving conversions.Product Page Image Testing: If you want to test different product images on your product page, URL Redirect Tests can be used to test these variations by redirecting traffic between original and duplicate pages.How URL Redirect Tests WorkThe core logic of a URL Redirect Test involves two main components:Trigger Conditions:These are predefined rules that determine when a redirect should occur. Trigger conditions can include:Matching specific page URLs or query strings.Using logical operators (AND/OR) to combine rules.Operators like \"Matches Exactly,\" \"Contains,\" \"Starts With,\" \"Ends With,\"Using regex patterns for complex matching.Test Group Settings :The destination URLs for each test group. Destination URLs are the URLs where users are redirected once the trigger conditions are met.The percentage of traffic allocated to each variation (e.g., 50% control, 50% test).Whether query strings should be preserved during redirection.How the Audience is SplitThe audience is divided into groups based on traffic allocation settings. Typically, visitors are randomly assigned to either the control group (original page) or one or more test groups (redirected pages). This ensures unbiased results and fair comparison between variations.Customer Experience ExampleOriginal Experience: A visitor lands on www.example.com/product and interacts with the original product page.Test Experience: A visitor lands on www.example.com/product but is redirected to www.example.com/product-test, which features modified content or design.ConclusionURL Redirect Tests provide a flexible way to compare webpage variations without altering the original content. By defining clear trigger conditions, splitting audiences fairly, and analyzing user behavior, businesses can make data-driven decisions about their web pages' content or design. This approach is particularly useful for testing landing pages or product pages while maintaining compatibility with ad policies from platforms like Google and Facebook.Learn more about URL testing and Google or Facebook Ads Policy here: Will I Violate Google or Facebook Ads Policy with URL Redirect Tests?\n\nPreviousShipping Tests - Shipping Rates MechanismNextURL Redirect Tests - How to Set UpLast updated 6 months ago"

This is particularly useful for testing variations of product pages, landing pages, or other key templates to determine which design or layout performs better. Template Tests operate by leveraging alternate templates in Shopify and using scripts to manage their display. The process involves:Assigning different templates to different types of pages (home page / collection page/ product page).Redirecting visitors to these templates based on test settings.Tracking performance metrics through analytics tools.This method enables you to test different designs without disrupting your live theme, making it a flexible and powerful tool for optimization.When Should I Choose Template Tests?Product Page Design Optimization: Template Tests are ideal for testing variations of product page layouts, such as different descriptions, image placements, or call-to-action buttons. This helps identify which design drives better engagement and conversions.Landing Page Performance Testing: Use Template Tests to experiment with alternate landing page designs and layouts to determine which one leads to higher conversion rates. This is especially useful for testing promotional campaigns or seasonal offers.Testing Multiple Templates Without URL Changes: If you want to test different designs while keeping the same URL structure (e.g., no redirects), Template Tests are the perfect choice. They allow you to dynamically render different templates through Shopify’s ?view=template-suffix system, ensuring a seamless user experience without altering page URLsFor more Template Test use cases, check out this document:🧩Template Test Use CasesHow Template Tests WorkSet Up Templates: Create or select alternate templates for the pages you want to test (e.g., product pages, collection pages, or home pages). These templates can include variations in layout, content placement, or design elements.Assign Templates to Variants: Assign the default template to the original group and the alternate template to the variant (test group). This ensures customers are split between the two experiences.When using ABConvert to run template tests on product pages, users often encounter confusion due to Shopify's limitation: a single product can only be assigned to one template at a time. The short answer is: the variant template in your test does not need to be assigned to the same product as the original template. It can be any published template within your theme.Preview and Test: Use the preview feature to ensure that both templates display correctly and align with your store's branding.Launch the Test: Start the test by splitting traffic between the control group (default template) and the test group (alternate template). Customers are automatically directed to one of the two templates during their visit.Monitor Analytics: Track key performance metrics such as bounce rate, time spent on page, conversion rate, and average order value (AOV) for each template. Analytics tools will help you compare how each template performs.Apply the Winner Template: If one template outperforms the other, you can make it the default for your store or continue testing further variations to optimize performance. Note that you need to manually apply the winner template to your store due to Shopify restrictions.Customer Experience ExampleHere’s an example of how a Template Test might look from a customer’s perspective:Original Experience: A customer visits a product page assigned to the default template. This template features standard product descriptions and layout elements.Test Experience: Another customer visits the same product page but is redirected to a variant template. This variant might include enhanced visuals or a different layout.ConclusionTemplate Tests provide a seamless way to optimize your Shopify store by comparing different designs and layouts. As customers interact with these pages, ABConvert tracks key metrics like conversion rates, time spent on pages, and add-to-cart actions. This data helps you identify which template resonates better with their audience and drives improved outcomes.

By comparing themes, you can determine which design elements and layouts work best for your customers, ultimately improving conversion rates.When Should I Choose Theme Tests?Consider using theme tests when:You want to test a new theme's compatibility and impact on existing metrics.You're interested in observing user behavior with different layouts.You need to ensure a theme performs well across various devices.For more Theme Test use cases, check out this document:🎨Theme Test Use CasesHow Theme Tests WorkTheme tests need to be ran independently from all other tests due to product restrictions. You need to end or pause all other A/B tests on ABConvert to run theme tests since the test scripts for the other tests only exist in the live theme. This restriction will ensure test accuracy.Prepare Themes: Ensure the themes you want to test are added to your Shopify theme library. These could include your current live theme and one or more alternate themes with different designs or layouts.Select Themes for Testing: In the theme test setup, choose your original theme (the current live theme) and your variant theme. Preview Themes: Use the preview feature to ensure each theme is functioning correctly, displays as intended, and aligns with your store’s branding.Launch the Test: Start the test and customers will be randomly assigned to experience one of the selected themes during their visit. You can set the traffic split percentage in the test settings.Monitor Analytics: Track key performance metrics such as click-through rate, conversion rates, and average order value (AOV) for each theme. Implement Changes: If a test theme performs better than your current live theme, you can make it your new default theme or continue testing additional variations for further optimization.Customer Experience ExampleOriginal Experience: A customer visits the online store and sees the default theme, which features a classic layout with a traditional navigation bar and standard product grid.Test Experience: Another customer visits the same store but is redirected to a test theme via a preview link. This variant theme might include a modern, minimalist design with enhanced visuals, such as larger product images and an innovative navigation menu.ConclusionTheme tests are essential for optimizing your Shopify store's appearance and functionality. By comparing different themes, you can identify the most effective design for your customers, leading to improved conversion and engagement. Regularly conduct these tests before making major changes to ensure your store remains appealing.For further assistance or questions, reach out via support@abconvert.io or use the in-app support widget.PreviousTemplate Tests - How to Set UpNextTheme Tests - How to Set UpLast updated 6 months ago"

Add-to-carts, checkouts, and orders in the entire store will be recorded. This view can provide insights into overall user behavior across all products. This view is beneficial for understanding broader trends and user interactions with your store as a whole.ConclusionBy focusing on key performance indicators like conversion rate and average order value across different test types, you can make data-driven decisions to optimize your store's performance. Always consider statistical significance when analyzing results to ensure that observed differences are meaningful and not due to random chance. We recommend accumulating at least 10,000 visitors or 200 orders for the sample size.PreviousPage Builder Apps - Template TestsNextAnalytics DiscrepanciesLast updated 6 months ago"
