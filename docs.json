    "text": "CopyPrice testsPrice Tests - Getting StartedWhat is Price Testing?Price testing is an experimental approach to assess the impact of offering a product at different price points. It uncovers valuable insights into customer demand, market trends, and optimal pricing strategies to maximize conversions.With the ABConvert app, conducting price tests is simple. You can quickly set up and customize tests by selecting products, defining test prices, and configuring traffic distribution rules—all in just a few clicks.How Price Tests work?Preparation: The setup process depends on your chosen testing method. Our current testing methods are: Duplicate Variant, Duplicate Product and Cart Transform. Refer to the next section for details on different approaches.Traffic Splitting: Traffic is split between the original product/variant and its duplicate(s). For instance, 50% of visitors are directed to the original price and 50% to the test price. Visitors are consistently shown the same price throughout the test.Data Collection: Scripts track user interactions on the product page, such as views, add-to-cart actions, checkouts, and purchases. All metrics are recorded and aggregated for analysis.Results Analysis: After running the test for a sufficient period, insights are derived from the data. Statistical tools are used to compare the performance of each price group, identifying the most effective pricing strategy.Price Test Methods ExplainedDuplicate Variant (Default)\nThis method creates duplicate options of a product for testing. For example, if a product has three purchase options, three additional purchase options are generated with test prices applied. On the frontend, our script ensures a seamless experience by hiding irrelevant purchase options for users based on their assigned test group.Duplicate Product\nThis method duplicates entire products with test prices applied, creating two or more identical products with different prices in the store. Users in each test group are only shown the product relevant to their group. Note that this method requires additional setup before launching the test. For more details on managing duplicate products, please refer to this article.Cart Transform (Shopify Plus Exclusive)\nShopify's cart transformation function dynamically adjusts prices when products are added to the cart. This method minimizes disruptions, avoids inventory tracking and theme configuration issues, and allows previews without impacting your live store.Next Steps?This article provides a foundational overview of price testing and the logic behind running tests.

    "text": "CopyShipping testsShipping Tests - Getting StartedGet started with running A/B tests on your Shopify shipping thresholds and rates with ABConvertWhat Are Shipping Tests?Shipping tests are experiments designed to evaluate and optimize the delivery options offered during the checkout process. By testing different shipping methods, rates, or configurations, you can identify the most effective options that maximizes conversion rate and sales. Shipping tests are crucial in the e-commerce landscape, where shipping plays an important role in purchase decisions.ABConvert uses Carrier Service API from Shopify to generate shipping rates. This service is available to stores in the Advanced or Plus plan.Refer to this article for more on how to enable Carrier Service API:How can I enable the Carrier Service API for my store? | ABConvert Help CentreWhen Should I Choose Shipping Tests?Shipping tests are ideal when:You want to compare different shipping rates (e.g., free shipping vs. flat-rate shipping).You're introducing new delivery options (e.g., express shipping or local pickup).You want to test out conditional shipping rates (e.g. adjust shipping fee based on product weight).Types of Shipping TestsThere are three types of shipping tests that provide value for different aspects in your store.Flat Rate: Allows you to test for different shipping rates. You can assess which flat rate leads to better performance with analytics results. Besides, you can set a free shipping threshold at the same time to ensure a complete shopping experience for your customers.Free Shipping Threshold: You can evaluates the impact of varying free shipping thresholds on customer behavior.Advanced Shipping: Allows you to implement multiple condition-based shipping rates to each test group. This method is particularly effective for tailoring shipping strategies to specific order details including order price, item weight and transit time.For more use cases, refer to this document:📦Shipping Test Use CasesHow Shipping Tests WorkShipping tests are built around Shopify's shipping profiles and require careful configuration to ensure accurate results. The logic of shipping tests is: Shipping Profiles and Zones: Each shipping test is linked to a specific shipping profile. You need to select the appropriate shipping zone for the test, ensuring that the rates apply only to customers in that region. Adding Test Rates: Define the shipping rates for each test variant (e.g., flat rate, free shipping threshold, or advanced shipping conditions). These rates are dynamically applied based on the test group assigned to the customer. Deleting Pre-existing Rates: Before launching the test, you must follow the steps in ABConvert to delete any existing rates that you want to A/B test in the shipping profile for the selected zone. The deleted rates will be automatically restored after you end the test. This ensures that only the test rates are applied during checkout. Analytics Tracking: Web pixel tracks user interactions with shipping options, including selection rates and their impact on conversion metrics like average order value (AOV) and checkout completion rates.Customer Experience ExampleHere’s an example of how a Shipping Test might look from a customer’s perspective:Original Experience: A customer visits the checkout page and sees a standard shipping rate with no free shipping option.Test Experience: Another customer visits the same checkout page but is presented with a test variant offering free shipping for orders over $50, encouraging the customer to add more items to their cart.ConclusionShipping testing is a powerful tool in the e-commerce world. By understanding and applying different shipping strategies, you can enhance customer experience and boost your sales. We encourage you to follow the instructions in the next article to optimize your store's performance. If you encounter issues with enabling carrier services, displaying shipping rates, or have questions about more advanced tests, don't hesitate to contact our support team at support@abconvert.io or via the in-app support widget.

    "text": "CopyURL Redirect testsURL Redirect Tests - Getting StartedGet started with running A/B tests on your PDPs, landing pages, collection pages, and more with ABConvertWhat Are URL Redirect Tests?A URL Redirect Test is a type of A/B testing where visitors are redirected to alternate URLs to compare the performance of different versions of a webpage. This method is particularly useful for testing variations of landing pages, product pages, or other key website elements without modifying the original page directly. When Should I Choose URL Redirect Tests?URL Redirect Tests are ideal in the following scenarios:Testing Landing Pages: When you want to compare the effectiveness of different landing pages in driving conversions.Product Page Image Testing: If you want to test different product images on your product page, URL Redirect Tests can be used to test these variations by redirecting traffic between original and duplicate pages.How URL Redirect Tests WorkThe core logic of a URL Redirect Test involves two main components:Trigger Conditions:These are predefined rules that determine when a redirect should occur. Trigger conditions can include:Matching specific page URLs or query strings.Using logical operators (AND/OR) to combine rules.Operators like \"Matches Exactly,\" \"Contains,\" \"Starts With,\" \"Ends With,\"Using regex patterns for complex matching.Test Group Settings :The destination URLs for each test group. Destination URLs are the URLs where users are redirected once the trigger conditions are met.The percentage of traffic allocated to each variation (e.g., 50% control, 50% test).Whether query strings should be preserved during redirection.How the Audience is SplitThe audience is divided into groups based on traffic allocation settings. Typically, visitors are randomly assigned to either the control group (original page) or one or more test groups (redirected pages). This ensures unbiased results and fair comparison between variations.Customer Experience ExampleOriginal Experience: A visitor lands on www.example.com/product and interacts with the original product page.Test Experience: A visitor lands on www.example.com/product but is redirected to www.example.com/product-test, which features modified content or design.ConclusionURL Redirect Tests provide a flexible way to compare webpage variations without altering the original content. By defining clear trigger conditions, splitting audiences fairly, and analyzing user behavior, businesses can make data-driven decisions about their web pages' content or design. This approach is particularly useful for testing landing pages or product pages while maintaining compatibility with ad policies from platforms like Google and Facebook.Learn more about URL testing and Google or Facebook Ads Policy here: Will I Violate Google or Facebook Ads Policy with URL Redirect Tests?\n\nPreviousShipping Tests - Shipping Rates MechanismNextURL Redirect Tests - How to Set UpLast updated 6 months ago"

This is particularly useful for testing variations of product pages, landing pages, or other key templates to determine which design or layout performs better. Template Tests operate by leveraging alternate templates in Shopify and using scripts to manage their display. The process involves:Assigning different templates to different types of pages (home page / collection page/ product page).Redirecting visitors to these templates based on test settings.Tracking performance metrics through analytics tools.This method enables you to test different designs without disrupting your live theme, making it a flexible and powerful tool for optimization.When Should I Choose Template Tests?Product Page Design Optimization: Template Tests are ideal for testing variations of product page layouts, such as different descriptions, image placements, or call-to-action buttons. This helps identify which design drives better engagement and conversions.Landing Page Performance Testing: Use Template Tests to experiment with alternate landing page designs and layouts to determine which one leads to higher conversion rates. This is especially useful for testing promotional campaigns or seasonal offers.Testing Multiple Templates Without URL Changes: If you want to test different designs while keeping the same URL structure (e.g., no redirects), Template Tests are the perfect choice. They allow you to dynamically render different templates through Shopify’s ?view=template-suffix system, ensuring a seamless user experience without altering page URLsFor more Template Test use cases, check out this document:🧩Template Test Use CasesHow Template Tests WorkSet Up Templates: Create or select alternate templates for the pages you want to test (e.g., product pages, collection pages, or home pages). These templates can include variations in layout, content placement, or design elements.Assign Templates to Variants: Assign the default template to the original group and the alternate template to the variant (test group). This ensures customers are split between the two experiences.When using ABConvert to run template tests on product pages, users often encounter confusion due to Shopify's limitation: a single product can only be assigned to one template at a time. The short answer is: the variant template in your test does not need to be assigned to the same product as the original template. It can be any published template within your theme.Preview and Test: Use the preview feature to ensure that both templates display correctly and align with your store's branding.Launch the Test: Start the test by splitting traffic between the control group (default template) and the test group (alternate template). Customers are automatically directed to one of the two templates during their visit.Monitor Analytics: Track key performance metrics such as bounce rate, time spent on page, conversion rate, and average order value (AOV) for each template. Analytics tools will help you compare how each template performs.Apply the Winner Template: If one template outperforms the other, you can make it the default for your store or continue testing further variations to optimize performance. Note that you need to manually apply the winner template to your store due to Shopify restrictions.Customer Experience ExampleHere’s an example of how a Template Test might look from a customer’s perspective:Original Experience: A customer visits a product page assigned to the default template. This template features standard product descriptions and layout elements.Test Experience: Another customer visits the same product page but is redirected to a variant template. This variant might include enhanced visuals or a different layout.ConclusionTemplate Tests provide a seamless way to optimize your Shopify store by comparing different designs and layouts.

This guide contains a list of all the available metrics in the ABConvert analytics dashboard.General Metric DefinitionsTotal Visitors (URL Redirect, Template, Theme Tests)Original / Variant (#)Total visitors is the number of visitors in the original or variant group. Each visitor is counted once for a purchasing journey. Each event will only be recorded once for a visitor.The visitor definition for URL redirect, template, and theme tests is different from Shopify. ABConvert’s visitor is recorded once per purchasing journey, so this metric might be smaller than the unique visitor in Shopify.Total Visitors (Price, Shipping, Checkout Tests)Original / Variant (#)Total visitors is the number of sessions in the original or variant group. Each session is counted once per visitor. A session starts when a visitor arrives on your site and ends after 30 minutes or when the browser is closed. The session is set in browser cookies.The visitors definition for price, shipping, and checkout tests is different from Shopify. ABConvert’s visitor is recorded every 30 minutes (with or without activity), so this metric might be larger than the unique visitor in Shopify.Conversion RatesMetricDescriptionFormulaAdd to Cart Rate (%)Percentage of sessions where a product was added to the cart.Number of add-to-cart events / Total number of visitorsCheckout Rate (%)Percentage of sessions where the checkout process was initiated.Number of checkout events / Total number of visitorsOrder Rate (%)Percentage of sessions resulting in an order.Number of orders / Total number of visitorsRevenue MetricsMetricDescriptionFormulaRevenue ($)Price Test: Total revenue of all products in the test.Shipping Test: Total subtotal revenue.

The session is set in a browser cookie.There will only be at most one click event in a session.Number of click events / Number of sessionsLeave without action rate (%)The percentage of sessions that has left the redirect destination page without doing any actions.An action is either a click or scroll.A session lasts 30 minutes. The session is set in a browser cookie.There will only be at most one leave without action (bounce) event in a session.Number of click events / Number of sessionsPrice Test Specific Filters: Viewing Analytics by Product vs. StorewideBy Product DataFocuses on metrics specific to each product, such as product views and actions taken on individual products. This view helps analyze performance at a granular level, useful for understanding how specific products are performing under different test conditions.By Storewide DataAggregates storewide data during the test period. Add-to-carts, checkouts, and orders in the entire store will be recorded. This view can provide insights into overall user behavior across all products. This view is beneficial for understanding broader trends and user interactions with your store as a whole.ConclusionBy focusing on key performance indicators like conversion rate and average order value across different test types, you can make data-driven decisions to optimize your store's performance. Always consider statistical significance when analyzing results to ensure that observed differences are meaningful and not due to random chance. We recommend accumulating at least 10,000 visitors or 200 orders for the sample size.PreviousPage Builder Apps - Template TestsNextAnalytics DiscrepanciesLast updated 6 months ago"

This is useful for developers or advanced users who want to apply logic based on whether a visitor is in the control or test group.How It WorksOur A/B testing script assigns visitors to a test group based on your test configuration and stores this information in the browser’s local storage.
